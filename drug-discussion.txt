8. Does the same model give you the same performance every time?

Yes, each model, even when repeated 10 times, gives the same results.
The reason might be that some classes are under represented, like Drug A, B and C have a lot less instances compared to Drug Y.
It could also be related to the distribution of the values of each feature, and the weight associated to each of them.
For example, the feature "Cholesterol" only has two values: High and Normal. Each of them have approximalety the same number of instances.
Considering this, if the weight of Cholesterol is significantly higherthan the other attributes, with only two values, 
it could make sense that there is little room for getting different results.
Another hypothesis is symply that the data collected is not big enough, and we should use a test sample of more than 40 instances.
