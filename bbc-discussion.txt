a) Precision would be the metric to focus on since finding relevant articles would be most important in this case while missing 
   would not be very detrimental, which is why the recall should be weighted less.

b) The performance differs between the steps for several reasons.
   Due to the change of smoothing values, which serves to elimanate zero probablility, lead to a change in the results.
   Aswell as the fact the the multinomial classifier had its random state set to null which made the train_test_split function
   return diffrent results every execution.
